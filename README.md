  <h1>A Generative AI Extension for the OHIF Viewer</h1>
  <p>This Repository contains the <strong>OHIF Viewer</strong> with an <strong>Generative AI </strong> extension, that enables the user to input a text and ganerates a CT scan of the chest. The OHIF Viewer is a medical image viewer
provided by the <a href="https://ohif.org/">Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF)</a>.  This extension requires an backend server to run the generative AI model (MedSyn) to convert text input into 3D CT scans.</p>

## Developing

### Branches

#### `master` branch - The latest dev (beta) release

- `master` - The latest dev release

This is typically where the latest development happens. Code that is in the master branch has passed code reviews and automated tests, but it may not be deemed ready for production. This branch usually contains the most recent changes and features being worked on by the development team. It's often the starting point for creating feature branches (where new features are developed) and hotfix branches (for urgent fixes).

Each package is tagged with beta version numbers, and published to npm such as `@ohif/ui@3.6.0-beta.1`

### `release/*` branches - The latest stable releases
Once the `master` branch code reaches a stable, release-ready state, we conduct a comprehensive code review and QA testing. Upon approval, we create a new release branch from `master`. These branches represent the latest stable version considered ready for production.

For example, `release/3.5` is the branch for version 3.5.0, and `release/3.6` is for version 3.6.0. After each release, we wait a few days to ensure no critical bugs. If any are found, we fix them in the release branch and create a new release with a minor version bump, e.g., 3.5.1 in the `release/3.5` branch.

Each package is tagged with version numbers and published to npm, such as `@ohif/ui@3.5.0`. Note that `master` is always ahead of the `release` branch. We publish docker builds for both beta and stable releases.

Here is a schematic representation of our development workflow:

![alt text](platform/docs/docs/assets/img/github-readme-branches-Jun2024.png)





### Requirements

- [Yarn 1.17.3+](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Yarn Workspaces should be enabled on your machine:
  - `yarn config set workspaces-experimental true`
- To make inference with MedSyn model GPU with 40GB RAM required


### Getting Started
#### Run Application
1. Clone this repository
   - `git clone https://github.com/TomWartm/Viewers.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned project's directory
3. `yarn install` to restore dependencies and link projects
4. [OPTIONAL] Start backend server `yarn orthanc:up` if you are not going to use the deployed Server API
5. Start the Application with Orthanc as backend `yarn dev:orthanc` (in a new terminal)
5a. IF YOU ARE NOT USING LOCAL DOCKER FOR ORTHANC: You can also just run `yarn dev` and it will work
6. You may need to update the frontend URL path to blackened located in this file: extensions/text-input-extension/src/GenerativeAIComponent.tsx
7. If you want to deploy the frontend, then you need to run `npm run build` then `firebase deploy`. Make sure you are in the root directory of the project.

#### Run Backend
0. For local development with the model: ssh -L 3443:localhost:3443 exouser@149.165.174.17
1. Clone the backend repository (on a machine with large GPU RAM)
    - `git clone https://github.com/TomWartm/MedsynBackend`
2. Navigate to the cloned project's directory
3. Install required python packages `conda env create --file environment.yml`
4. Activate environment `conda activate medsyn-3-8`
5. Navigate to src folder
6. Run flask server `python app.py`

#### The Orthanc Server on GCP VM
- The orthanc server is running through a docker setup. To confirm the docker proceses are running you type `docker ps`. To stop the docker from running: `docker-compose down` and to restart it after making changes `docker-compose up -d`. To check its status navigate to `cd platform/app/.recipes/Nginx-Orthanc/` then `docker-compose ps` and you will see the nginx-proxy running (this is for proxying the local host of the VM to the web domain through SSL) and the orthancPACS running which is the database for the images.
- If the ortahnc.katelyncmorrison.com web domain ssl certificate needs to be renewed, you need to follow the following steps:
1. stop the docker `cd GenAIxRad-Viewer/platform/app/.recipes/Nginx-Orthanc/` then `docker-compose down`
2. renew the cert: `sudo certbot renew --nginx`
3. restart the docker `docker-compose up -d`
4. confirm everything is working the way it should be.

#### Notes about Backend
- Always shelve the VM when you are done using it
- Don't release the Public IP Address
- Open the web desktop to activate conda environment in the terminal (only need to start from step 4)

#### Add dummy Data
Add NIfTI files to the folder `data/nifti` (some are available on our google drive) and use the notebook in `backend/nifti_to_orthan.ipynb` to converti files into DICOM and upload to the Orthanc server.

#### Deploying to Live Site hosted on Firebase
- First run `yarn:build` in the root directory `GenAIxRad-Viewer/` which may take several minutes to build if you have made a lot of changes.
- Once that is completed building then run `firebase deploy` - it should say something like `i  hosting[genai-radiology]: found 442 files in platform/app/dist` - if it doesn't say this then you are in the wrong directory (it may say slightly more or less than 442 files if you added or deleted some files)


#### Pinging the Model API on PSC
(this may be helpful: https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/user-guide/)
* RunMedSyn.ipnyb in this folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BW8n9D_nBhsLVCdVsN52JaO72Ky23AdI](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cnKxtEfCOsOYPCQ2xxBLiIYqnj-2ipZR)
* You need the whole folder on PSC in your home directory
* You need to set up the conda environment:
    - `module load anaconda3`
    - `conda activate # source /opt/packages/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`
    - go to MedSyn folder, run `conda env create --file environment.yml`
    - `conda activate medsyn-3-8`
    - if you didn't do this, then `conda install ipykernel` and `python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name medsyn-3-8 --display-name "PYTHON-medsyn-3-8"`
    - When you launch a jupyter notebook, you have to set Extra Slurm Args to --gres=gpu:v100-32:4
    - partition it to GPU-shared
    - after you generate an image from there, you can if you want run `nifti-to-orthanic.ipynb` in the GenAIViewer Repo to view image in the UI OR you can use ITK-SNAP program instead

# Restore dependencies
yarn install
```

## Howto
### Manually load images
To manually load images into the Tool you can drag-and-drop with the Upload feature on the study overview page, opload directly to Orthanc server on its interface (`http://localhost:8042/app/explorer.html`) or programmatically with python (check `backend/nifti_to_orthanc.ipynb`)

## Backend
Images are stored on a the Orthanc server you can open up the Interface running on `http://localhost:8042/app/explorer.html`.
