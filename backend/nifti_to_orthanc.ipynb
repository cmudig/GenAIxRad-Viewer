Other mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Linear atelectasis is present in both lung parenchyma. Subsegmental atelectasis is observed in the right middle lobe. Thickening of the bronchial wall and peribronchial budding tree-like reticulonodular densities are observed in the bilateral lower lobes. Peribronchial minimal consolidation is seen in the lower lobes in places. The findings were evaluated primarily in favor of the infectious process. The left kidney partially entering the section is atrophic. The right kidney could not be evaluated because it did not enter the section. Other upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. There are osteophytes with anterior extension in the thoracic vertebrae.\"\n",

Heart contour, the size is natural. There is minimal pericardial effusion. The effusion measuring approximately 80 mm in size is observed on the right. There is an area of increased density in the lung parenchyma adjacent to the effusion, which is considered secondary to compressive atelectasis. No pathological increase in wall thickness was observed in the thoracic esophagus. In the mediastinum, in both axillary regions and in the supraclavicular fossa, no lymph nodes were observed in pathological size and appearance. In the lower lobe of the left lung, there is an area of increase in density consistent with the consolidation observed in the air bronchograms. Although the appearance may be secondary to atelectasis, underlying pneumonic infiltration cannot be excluded. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory findings. No mass lesion was observed in both lungs. There are a few millimetric nodules in the left lung, the largest of which is 5.5x3.5 mm in the upper lobe inferior lingular segment. Emphysematous changes were observed in both lungs.

No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the mediastinum. No lymph node was observed in pathological size and appearance in the supraclavicular and axillary fossa. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; In both lungs, ground-glass densities including central-peripheral, crazy paving pattern and consolidation areas showing signs of vascular enlargement were observed. The outlook is consistent with Covid-19 pneumonia. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. Diffuse linear subsegmental atelectatic changes were observed in the middle and lower lobes of the right lung. There are segmental-subsegmental bronchiectatic changes and peribronchial thickening in both lungs. Sequelae thickening was observed in the posterocostal pleura in both hemithorax. No mass lesion with distinguishable borders was detected in both lungs. A hypodense lesion area of 21x20 mm was observed at the junction of segment 4A-8 at the level of the liver dome and could not be characterized in this examination. The gallbladder was not observed (operated). The right adrenal gland and right kidney were not observed (operated). Diffuse thickening was observed in the left adrenal gland. Within the sections, free fluid-pathological lymph node was not observed in the abdomen. Mild dextroscoliosis with left opening was observed at the thoracic level. At mid-thoracic level, a bridging spur formation is observed in the right anterolateral corners of the vertebrae. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved.\"\n",

There are a few areas of groundglass opacity in the right lung present, but the major finding is the pulmonary fibrosis that is most significant in the basilar regions. Pleural spaces:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There are no areas of significant pleural thickening demonstrated. Mediastinum and Lymph Nodes:  There is no pathologic adenopathy demonstrated in the axilla, mediastinum, or hilar regions. Heart and vascular structures: There is cardiomegaly. There is a cardiac pacemaker in place. There are small areas of atherosclerotic disease present, likely to include in the coronary arteries. There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta. There is no significant pericardial effusion. Esophagus and visualized portion of the gastrointestinal tract: There is a mildly dilated partially fluid-filled distal esophagus. This could represent a hiatal hernia. Osseous structures and chest wall:  Unremarkable without acute or significant non-degenerative abnormalities.

There are milder areas of abnormality in the subpleural right greater than left upper lung zones. There are mild areas of groundglass opacity in the right upper lung zone, but there is no consolidation in the lungs. There are no suspicious pulmonary mass lesions.
